  60301, 	"Some applications obtain the shell desktop folder and invoke the Release() method too many times, resulting in the object being destroyed prematurely. This compatibility fix invokes the AddRef() method on the desktop folder returned by the SHGetDesktopFolder function to counteract the erroneous Release()."
  60302, 	"Some updaters/upgrade installers running elevated requires HKCU settings created by the application at runtime. This shim is intended to fix the Over-the-Shoulder scenario where the application has not been run in the elevated user, but has run in standard users. It scans the existing user profiles in the machine and attempts to copy the specified keys into HKEY_CURRENT_USER."
  60303, 	"The purpose of this shim is to duplicate the newly created HKCU keys to other users HKCU, namely HKUS\\{SID}, at the end of the process. Command line parameters are used to restrict the subtrees to detect the new key creation. This is a generic mitigation to the UAC Over-The-Shoulder installation that creates HKCU keys which are required by the app at runtime."
