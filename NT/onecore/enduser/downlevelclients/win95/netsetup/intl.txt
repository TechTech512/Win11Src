=============================
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
PAN-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
=============================

Windows Me includes all the support provided in the Pan-
European Edition of Windows 95 and the support provided in 
Windows 98 and Windows 98 Second Edition. It provides both 
program support and document support for markets that did 
not have a localized version of Windows 95, Windows 98, or 
Windows 98 Second Edition.


===============
PROGRAM SUPPORT
===============

Windows Me provides support for localized programs. For example, 
you can run Russian Microsoft Office 2000 on Microsoft Me.


================
DOCUMENT SUPPORT
================

You can use Windows Me to create a multilingual document with 
TrueType fonts in all programs that support TrueType fonts. For 
example, you can now create a document in Microsoft Word 2000 
for Windows that includes Czech, Russian, Greek, and French text.


===================================
INSTALLING SUPPORT FOR YOUR COUNTRY
===================================

You can install this version of Windows Me by upgrading from an 
existing installation of Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows 98 
Second Edition. By default, your existing settings are detected 
and maintained. For example, when you upgrade from Polish 
Microsoft Windows 95, your default regional settings are still 
in Polish, your default keyboard still generates Polish 
characters, and you run your Windows-based programs as you 
did before.

If you install Windows Me on a computer that is currently 
running MS-DOS only, you should specify the language, country/
region and keyboard layout you want during Setup. The default 
is English and the United States. 

To change your regional settings:

1. During Setup, select the Custom option in the Windows Me 
   Setup wizard.
 
2. In the Language dialog box, click your spoken language. 
   Click Next to continue.

3. In the Country/Region dialog box, click your country. 
   Click Next to continue.

4. In the Keyboard Layout dialog box, click your preferred 
   keyboard. Click Next to continue.

Setup then installs these regional settings and keyboard 
layout values for Windows-based and MS-DOS-based programs. 

NOTE: Some languages default to the U.S. keyboard that is 
defined for MS-DOS windows and MS-DOS-based programs.


=================
REGIONAL SETTINGS
=================

Windows Me defines which Windows and MS-DOS code pages and 
system fonts are installed on your computer. You cannot change 
these settings after Setup. 

Regional Settings also defines which international settings--
such as date, currency, time formats, and sort orders for 
programs your computer will use. 

To change your international settings after Setup:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Open Regional Settings. If you do not see the Regional Settings 
   icon, click View All Control Panel Options.

3. On the Regional Settings tab, select the appropriate language 
   and country/region.

4. To change your number, currency, time, and date settings, 
   click the respective tab, and then make your changes.

5. Click OK.

Regardless of whether you are upgrading over Windows 95, 
Windows 98, or Windows 98 Second Edition, it is recommended 
that you verify that your regional settings have been detected 
correctly.


========================================
UPGRADING FROM THE PAN-EUROPEAN EDITION 
OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95, U.S. EDITION OF 
WINDOWS 98, OR WINDOWS 98 SECOND EDITION
========================================

When you are upgrading from the Pan-European Edition of 
Windows 95, U.S. Edition of Windows 98, or Windows 98 Second 
Edition, the upgrade is performed automatically, using the 
current regional settings and keyboard values.


==================================
UPGRADING FROM THE U.S. EDITION OF
MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95, WINDOWS 98, 
OR WINDOWS 98 SECOND EDITION
==================================

When you are upgrading from the U.S. Edition of Windows 95, 
Windows 98, or Windows 98 Second Edition, the Language, 
Country, and Keyboard screens will appear if the following 
two conditions are met: 

- At least two keyboards are installed.

- Multilanguage Support is installed.

NOTE: If these two conditions are not met, these screens do 
not appear. The existing settings are used and upgraded 
automatically.

If the Language, Country/Region and Keyboard screens appear, 
you can select your respective settings and then during
Setup these values are used.


SWEDISH KEYBOARD ISSUE
======================
A Swedish user booting off the Windows Millennium Edition 
Emergency Boot Disk finds that the keyboard has Slovenian 
characters instead of Swedish characters.

CAUSE
=====
Inconsistency between W95 and W98 in using SW or SV for Swedish 
and Slovenian in MsDOS mode.  Correct abbreviation for Swedish 
in Windows Millennium Edition is SW.

RESOLUTION
==========
Edit config.sys on the EBD and change regional and keyboard 
settings installed to SW.



MULTILINGUAL FEATURES IN WINDOWS ME
===================================

You can use Windows Me to create documents in many different 
languages. For example, you can create documents in Central 
European, Cyrillic, Baltic-based languages, Greek, or Turkish. 
After Windows Me is installed, refer to "Multilingual Documents, 
Creating" in Windows Help and Support for more information.

In Windows Me, you can also load multiple keyboard layouts in 
Windows programs. This makes it easy to create multilingual 
documents. To switch between keyboards, press the left 
ALT+SHIFT. For more information, refer to "Keyboard, layout" 
in Windows Help and Support.
