# Windows 11 source code

This is the (partially) leaked source code of Microsoft's latest and greatest operating system, Windows 11.

Be aware that due to the closed-source state of the operating system, and the fact it's the latest Windows version that gets updates everyday which shows that Microsoft constantly takes care of it, and the fact there aren't any EXE/DLL/OCX/etc decompilers that have the capability of restoring at least the majority of the Windows 11 system files to their EXACT source code before they got compiled, it's really impossible to get the source code for the majority of the Windows 11 files and all the files in this repository are based on extracting resources from DLLs using ResHacker, some modified files from the Windows XP/Server 2003 source code, and finally a portion of the NT 10.0 source code that is officially leaked by Microsoft THEMSELVES (check Windows 11 24H2 SDK). This also includes parts of the Windows conhost source code.


No copyright infringement intended as well and the Windows 11 operating system is Microsoft's trademark.

\NT\ is your starting folder. Will update you once I get access to more components.
